# MovieFinder
This project will read a list of movies, find the first movie on the list you haven't seen, and download it.

## Program Steps
1. Check to make sure there are fewer than 10 movies in the destination folder (so that you don't have too many clogging up space).
2. Open an Excel spreadsheet containing a list of movies, release years, and an indication of whether or not they have been watched yet. See the example file.
3. Find the first movie on the list that has not been watched yet.
4. Check to see if it already exists in the destination folder. If it does, find the next movie on the list that has not been watched yet, then repeat step 4.
5. Find the movie online and download it.
6. Close the spreadsheet

## Instructions
Keep your destination folder clean. Delete movies after you watch them, and don't put other stuff in this folder. Keep your spreadsheet up to date, so that the program doesn't download a film you've already watched. This program is intended to be run once per day, so if you go 10 days without watching a movie it will fill up your folder and then stop running.

## No Piracy
This program should not be used for piracy, or downloading copyrighted/illegal things. I like to watch old silent films which are in the public domain; if you use it for something nefarious, that's on you. By using this program, you agree to not use it to break the law or be a jerk.
